# AnyBoot: Your Multi-Boot Workstation, Simplified.

## The Problem

Setting up a multi-boot PC with Windows, Linux, and maybe even BSD is powerful, but it's often complex, risky, and time-consuming. Users face challenges like:

*   Partitioning mistakes leading to data loss.
*   Bootloader conflicts breaking existing operating systems.
*   Repeated reboots for each OS installation.
*   Difficulty managing and updating different OS installers (ISOs).
*   Achieving a consistent, reproducible setup.

## Our Solution: AnyBoot

AnyBoot is a revolutionary tool that runs from a simple USB stick, transforming the way you set up and manage multi-boot systems.

Think of it as your **personal OS installation studio**.

AnyBoot provides a safe, guided environment where you can:

1.  **Design Your Ideal Layout:** Visually plan your disk partitions for all desired operating systems.
2.  **Prepare Safely:** Download OS installers (ISOs) and let AnyBoot configure the partitions correctly.
3.  **Install Without Risk:** AnyBoot installs each OS in a controlled, virtualized way directly onto your *real* hard drive partitions, without needing constant reboots or risking your primary system.
4.  **Boot Seamlessly:** Once done, AnyBoot sets up a beautiful, modern boot menu (rEFInd) that automatically detects all your installed operating systems.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **User-Friendly:** Guided interface for both graphical (web-based) and text-mode users.
*   **Safe & Controlled:** Installs OSes via emulation (QEMU) targeting real disk space, minimizing risk.
*   **Flexible & Incremental:** Install just Windows now, add Linux later. Or set up everything at once.
*   **Portable:** Runs entirely from a USB stick with persistent storage for your configurations and ISOs.
*   **Reproducible:** Save and reuse your configurations for consistent setups across machines.
*   **Always Up-to-Date:** Includes tools to easily fetch the latest versions of your favorite OS installers.
