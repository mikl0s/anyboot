# AnyBoot: Project Insights & Lessons Learned

## Introduction

This document serves as a shared knowledge base for the AnyBoot development team. Its purpose is to capture key insights, discoveries, solutions to tricky problems, and lessons learned during the development process. By documenting these, we aim to avoid repeating mistakes, onboard new developers more quickly, and maintain a collective understanding of *why* certain decisions were made.
